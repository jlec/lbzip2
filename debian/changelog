lbzip2 (0.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release implements process termination with SIGPIPE and
    SIGXFSZ. This matches the traditional UNIX(R) utility behavior more, and
    should improve cooperation with GNU tar.
  * Adapt the "man-inst-paths" patch to the updated manual page.

  * New upstream release fixes a SUSv2-nonconformity in the "lfs.sh" build
    script.
  * As Daniel Baumann <daniel@debian.org> advised:
    - remove all prerequisites of "binary-indep" in debian/rules,
    - reformat debian/copyright to a list of "Header: value" pairs.

 -- Laszlo Ersek <lacos@caesar.elte.hu>  Fri, 19 Feb 2010 00:06:08 +0100

lbzip2 (0.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release fixes a negligible probability race between the muxer
    thread printing an error message due to a write error, and the main thread
    freeing the output file name after catching a SIGINT or SIGTERM. The bug
    was introduced in 0.18-1.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4 from 3.8.3. No changes necessary after
    checking unstable's "upgrading-checklist.txt.gz".

 -- Laszlo Ersek <lacos@caesar.elte.hu>  Wed, 17 Feb 2010 23:20:21 +0100

lbzip2 (0.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release cleans up theoretical portability problems:
    - don't rely on character constants '1' and '9' being encoded in ASCII,
    - replace non-C89 flexible array members (struct hacks) with ordinary
      pointer dereferences.

lbzip2 (0.19-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release checks for most errno macros before relying on them
    (Closes: #559052).

 -- Laszlo Ersek <lacos@caesar.elte.hu>  Tue, 01 Dec 2009 23:25:12 +0100

lbzip2 (0.18-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Based on Laszlo Boszormenyi's remark in
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2009/12/msg00001.html, updated
    compat to reflect debhelper compatibility level (7).
  * Fix consequently appearing "dh-clean-k-is-deprecated" lintian warning:
    replace "dh_clean -k" with "dh_prep" in rules.

 -- Laszlo Ersek <lacos@caesar.elte.hu>  Tue, 01 Dec 2009 02:49:31 +0100

lbzip2 (0.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Add sanity checks to both decompressors.
    - Remove input FILE operands.
    - Implement options --keep and --force.
    - Copy file attributes from original to (de)compressed.
    - Add new exit status 4 to signal warnings.
    - (Author eats his own dog-food, replaced bzip2 with lbzip2 on his system.)
  * Author switched to cvsnt from cvs; change date separators from "-" to "/"
    in the substituted $Id$ value in patches/makefile.
  * Adapt line numbers in patches/man-inst-paths to updated manual page.
  * Following Anibal Monsalve Salazar's advice in
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2009/11/msg00511.html, convert the
    package to "3.0 (quilt)" and bz2 format:
    - update debhelper build-dependency to >= 7,
    - remove quilt references from control and rules,
    - add source/format and source/options,
    - remove README.source altogether.

lbzip2 (0.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release fixes possible undefined behavior, reported by Paul
    Wise in http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2009/10/msg00470.html.
  * Adapt the "debian-sanity" target to the new environment variables
    introduced by lbzip2-0.16rc1.

    - Add -Wall to CFLAGS.
    - Add descriptive headers to the makefile and manual page patches.

lbzip2 (0.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - handle signals and problems with input/output files more gracefully,
    - close standard output after (de)compressing to it from file operands.
  * debian/rules: unpatch the source as the last step of the "clean" target, so
    that the package can be built more than once in a row.
  * debian/changelog, debian/control, debian/copyright: refresh e-mail address.
  * Replace version string of previous changelog entry ("0.16rc1-1") with
    "0.16~rc1-1" for correct ordering; thanks to Ruben Molina in
    <6d57146c1ed5d6a38b1320ab63f163c7.squirrel@200.24.17.170>.

lbzip2 (0.16~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (candidate):
    - (Mostly) bzip2-compatible command-line, e.g. settable compression block
      size, file operands etc. However, lbzip2 never deletes or overwrites
      files it didn't create.
    - Merged eglibc getconf bug workaround (patches/eglibc-getconf) from
      0.15-2.
  * Changed the "bzip2 filter program" substring in the short description to
    "bzip2 utility".
  * Adapted "patches/man-inst-paths" to new upstream manual page.

 -- Laszlo Ersek <lacos@caesar.elte.hu>  Wed, 21 Oct 2009 04:48:38 +0200

lbzip2 (0.15-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move those patches from the 0.15-1 diff.gz that were modifying upstream
    files ("Makefile" and "lbzip2.1") under debian/patches. Also
    - extend Build-Depends with quilt,
    - after including "quilt.make", make the "build-stamp" target depend on
      $(QUILT_STAMPFN),
    - add "README.source" to make users aware of quilt.
  * Temporarily extend the glibc getconf bug workaround in "lfs.sh" to eglibc
    getconf. Patch will be probably merged in a new upstream version.
  * Update Homepage to lacos.hu.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3 from 3.8.1 without any changes, after
    verifying the package against sid's upgrading-checklist.txt.gz.
  * Change the package description according to suggestions by Ben Finney and
    Justin B Rye on the debian-l10n-english mailing list.

lbzip2 (0.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. From the upstream ChangeLog:
    - fix a (theoretically occurring) wrongful "premature EOF" error in the
      single-worker decompressor,
    - clean up buffer sizes for IO-friendliness and logical independece,
    - document the derivation of the multiple-workers decompressor's splitter
      block size,
    - enable users to track peak memory usage with "malloc_trace.pl".
  * Follow upstream's change from -O3 to -O2 in "debian/rules".
    - Since lbzip2 is multi-threaded, "-fpredictive-commoning" (enabled at -O3)
      seems scary.
    - See also Don Armstrong's mail <20090217002744.GP25486@rzlab.ucr.edu>
      (http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2009/02/msg00155.html).

lbzip2 (0.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Modify the following files in order to comply with Standards-Version 3.8.1,
    specifically Debian Policy Manual 4.9.1, "nocheck" build option:
    - Makefile: the "install" target depends on $(INSTDEP) now, instead of the
      fixed "debian-sanity" target.
    - debian/rules: if "nocheck" is absent, make installation depend on
      "debian-sanity", like before; if "nocheck" is present, make installation
      depend only on "lbzip2".
    - debian/control: bump Standards-Version.

lbzip2 (0.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #507492). Thanks to Anibal Monsalve Salazar for
    guidance. Thanks to Paul Wise for guidance and sponsoring.
  * In lbzip2.1: debianized README and malloc_trace.pl pathnames.
  * In Makefile:
    - removed $Id$,
    - moved macro definitions from Makefile to debian/rules,
    - removed "check" target (which supports interactive testing with a big
      external file),
    - added "install" target (thanks to Sedat Dilek for squashing a bashism
      (brace expansion)).
    - Installation depends on the "debian-sanity" target, which executes some
      basic compression/decompression tests.
    - Extended the "clean" target's action to remove the temporary files
      created by "debian-sanity".
